# EY-Techathon-4.0

This repository comprises of all the code for the fullstack machine learning website which helps to predict and diagnose diseases and uses AI chatbot to prescribe remedies

The backend folder contains all the FastAPI calls made by the website to predict the images
Unfortunately due to large size of the machine learning models, I was unable to upload them here
(But I will be adding the training code soon)

The frontend folder contains React.js website components
